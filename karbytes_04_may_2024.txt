To Whom It May Concern:

Within the past 48 hours I decided to return the (gasoline powered) Toyota Matrix minivan to my parents (who own that vehicle and who gave me permission to borrow it). I plan to rely exclusively on public transportation, bicycling, and walking to get around for the next five plus years. I also tentatively plan on renting a Waymo taxi or some other all-electric and all-self-driving taxi and making a small video documentary of my ride as soon as the next "chapter" of this blog (and that chapter is to be named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_13).

Also during the past 48 hours I have been thinking a lot about how artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the economy (by enabling many if not most human jobs to be outsourced to robots) and helping to reveal how seemingly most human jobs are little more than "busy work" done almost exclusively to garner a paycheck while contributing very little pragmatic value to people other than the employee's own household and daresay even hindering society for the sake of accommodating the mentally and physically rigid poor (who seem most likely to sexually reproduce and hence increase the competition over finite resources to the extent that people are becoming increasingly gridlocked by over population and under generation and distribution of resources). While "normal" people gripe that they cannot do anything but conform to the impoverished and impoverishing status quo and use it as an excuse to be intellectually and morally lame, I have been making and intend to continue making a conscious effort to focus more on the future than on the past and more on engineering and exploration more than on gossip and grieving.

Many people seem to think I should be forced to be poor and unproductive (with respect to my aims) in order to accommodate the tyrannical envy, embitteredness, and cowardice of the "moral majority" who "shamelessly" consume meat from enslaved and slaughtered animals, combust fossil fuels (which releases toxic chemicals into the atmosphere), and pander almost exclusively to the patriarchal subjugation of women  in favor of exalting young, arrogant, uneducated, mean boys as society's most idolized people. I don't wait for other people's approval to go about my business (and I'm always busy working on my own projects of personal significance). Unlike seemingly most people, I am not looking for some partner to "settle down" with nor am I endeavoring to have sex with people other than myself. My emotional self sufficiency and unusually high self esteem seems to compel other people to bully me seemingly multiple times daily. I think such people want to get rid of me or at least censor me because they don't want me promoting the idea that one can live a happy and meaningful life without having to have sex with people other than oneself, without personally burning petroleum, and without consuming animal flesh. Apparently, I am privileged merely for being a vegan and a celibate loner. I cannot help but assume that, deep down, almost every human would also want to be vegan celibate loners but it is painful for them to admit that such a lifestyle is inaccessible to them due to the fact that they are very oppressed and micromanage into conformity by the petroleum dependent, covertly rapist, and staunchly anti intellectual patriarchal status quo. I'm not waiting for more people to challenge the status quo before I take action (and I am always in the midst of solving big and small problems with or without support from other people).

Beyond all contexts, I am all I have (and I do think I am a mind). I have what I think is a vast and daresay even growing internalized database of personal knowledge which is substantiated by my brain and, to a peripheral extent, by my web based (and 100% digital) intellectual property. I think that "dying of old age" is entirely preventable and so is "age related decline of abilities" due to the fact that old cells in my body (which allegedly only have a finite number of cell divisions before they stop dividing) can be replaced by genetically and structurally identical lab-grown cells derived from my own stem cells. 

Finally, I intend to make my health a higher priority than I used to (much to the dismay of my enemies) and avoid prolonged or frequent exposure to toxic pollution and personalities.

Sincerely,
karbytes 

Post Script: I sometimes prefer to engage in conspiracy theory based role play and thought experiments (and actual experiments) in order to explore new ideas and perspectives and to solve problems. I see that my attempts to be "politically correct" are purely vanity. I no longer make a special effort to censor myself in front of children and "vulnerable" people, help the poor, or tell people other than myself and those I am paid to supervise what to do. Nevertheless, I do my best to not engage in nor escalate interpersonal conflict even if that means I tell people lies or that I not disclose my most candid thoughts and feelings with people. I have myself to call my forever home and forever friend. I do not ever want someone else to take the place of who I am to me, myself, and I as a self-contained system of friends who are extremely dedicated to the proliferation of karbytes. It is functionally the same thing as saying that God is my best friend by far and the only "person" I really aim to impress and serve.
