I decided to share and commentate on a recent conversation I had with ChatGPT-4 on my public website (i.e. Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) because that particular conversation revealed to me that the online identity which I have been cultivating during the past four plus years is currently known to ChatGPT (and, if it is known to ChatGPT, then it is likely known to other information processing agents which have access to the World Wide Web) and is, according to the particular runtime instance of ChatGPT-4 which I conversed with in the aforemention conversation, firmly established on the World Wide Web (rather than relegated to obscurity like what Spencer Eugene Dyer appeared to be according to that ChatGPT-4 instance) and established as a proponent of computer science tutorials, metaphysical discourse, and disclosures about karbytes' own personal development experiences and ideas.

(I was also fortunate to be able to chat on the phone with Alan Jason Ponte after having not interacted with each other since the early summer of the year 2023 (and that last conversation we had in 2023 was a phone call which occurred while I was walking to my camp site northeast of Lake Chabot Regional Park in order to work on exponentiation-related C++ tutorial web pages for my now (apparently complete and finalized) public website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com). I originally befriended Alan between the years 2012 and 2015 when both of us were working at the Information Technology Collaboration Services department of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as software developers. I consider us to now to be good friends even though we rarely interact with each other due to the fact that both of us are very busy, ambitious, and solitude-loving. I hope and expect us to remain good friends for the rest of our lives. I value our friendship because Alan Jason Ponte is someone who shares many of my interests and who, like me, seems to want to always be learning and accomplishing things in the computer technology sector. I think it is very likely that I will eventually befriend more people who also share many of my interests and who help keep me up to date on what is trending in science and technology. Spencer Eugene Dyer, despite being one of the closest friends I ever had (and we were essentially living together between the years 2009 and 2015) and someone who contributed significantly to my interest and personal development in computer technology and physical science, is someone I have not been in contact with since 2015 and only for approximately 20 seconds in 2020 after we separated and he moved into his own residence with his new domestic partner. I do not know where he currently lives or whether or not he has any online presence which is still active but I do remember him stating on his LinkedIn profile that he was working as a software developer at Tesla).

Based on what the aforementioned conversation revealed about my public web presence, I would say that my online identity and overall professionalism (and spirituality) is still in its infancy despite appearing to be quite robust in terms of content volume and clarity about some academic topics which most interest me. I expect to ask ChatGPT and other Large Language Models about karbytes in the future and after I augment Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com with more sophisticated and impressive content. Hopefully the feedback I will be given by those chat bots is a description of karbytes which does not make karbytes seem so amateur, naive, and tepid in its intellectual discourses. I am a little embarassed by how "shallow" and "beginner-ish" my current Internet presence appears to myself (and perhaps to others) to be. At the same time, I am optimistic that, within the next ten to twenty years, I will become a lot more advanced than I currently am as a student of computer science, consciousness, and (meta)physics and that such refinement of knowledge and skill will be evident in my future web content.

(Note that the hyperlinks which ChatGPT provided which reference web pages which I created are links to what I consider to be outdated (i.e. pre-karbytes) content. What I consider to be my most up to date content is featured on the karbytes-created website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com, the karbytes-created website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com, and the karbytes-created GitHub account whose username is @karlinarayberinger. Finally, my preferred gender pronouns are it/its (firstly), they/them (secondly), he/him (thirdly), and she/her (fourthly)).

What is the average daily income of an adult living in the United States of America?

The average daily income of adults in the United States can vary based on several factors including employment status and geographic location. However, using annual income as a reference, the mean personal income in the United States was reported as $59,430 for the year 2022. This translates to about $162 per day if you divide the annual figure by 365 days (FRED).

For a more specific breakdown, in the fourth quarter of 2023, the median weekly income of full-time wage and salary American workers was reported to be $1,142, which approximates to around $163 per day assuming a seven-day week (Oberlo | Where Self Made is Made).
